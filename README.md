The Supply Chain Dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of key performance indicators (KPIs) related to supply chain operations. It enables stakeholders to monitor efficiency, identify bottlenecks, and optimize logistics. Key insights include inventory management, order fulfillment, supplier performance, logistics, demand forecasting, and cost analysis. The dashboard highlights stock levels, processing times, supplier reliability, transportation costs, and operational bottlenecks. Predictive analytics help in demand forecasting, preventing stockouts or overstocking. Cost analysis showcases procurement and transportation expenses, aiding cost-saving initiatives. The dashboard also monitors customer satisfaction through order accuracy, fulfillment speed, and feedback. It serves as a vital tool for decision-makers to enhance efficiency and reduce operational risks. By leveraging data-driven insights, businesses can improve supply chain resilience and responsiveness.
